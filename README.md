# dafprank

It looks like a default browser error page:

But start talking: you will hear your voice in headphones a fraction of a second later. This is called Delayed Auditory Feedback (DAF), and it can induce mental stress, making it very difficult (or impossible) to talk. But it can also be used to treat stuttering, conduct speech perception experiments, and even mess up bird singing for adult zebra finches.

### Camouflage

After opening Dafprank in a browser and letting it use the microphone, you can "camouflage" it by opening another tab, going to another app, minimizing the browser, or turning off the screen.

Unfortunately the visibility of the REC/microphone icon is a standard browser security feature, so it may give away Dafprank for the time being.

### Audio feedback

DAF usually works best with noise cancelling headphones, because speakers can generate significant audio feedback. But because this is a prank, audio feedback may or may not be a bad side effect. You decide.
